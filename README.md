BIG DATA CHALLENGE 

The Big Data Challenge from R2 Data Labs, Emergent Alliance and Code First Girls is an inquiry-driven experiential learning programme that invites individuals to strengthen their problem-solving and critical thinking skills while gaining familiarity with the fundamentals of data science. Utilising challenge statements and data sets pulled together by R2 Data Labs and IBM (Emergent Alliance partner), participants will model historical data using their knowledge of data science, analytics tools and techniques while basing their observations on the data provided. Teams can also use additional open data in their projects.

Introduction

To mitigate the health impacts of COVID-19, the UK government is continuously adapting its response and stringency measures. The measures began on 16th March 2020 with an announcement that all unnecessary contact should cease, leading to a national lockdown on 23rd March, which included the closing of non-essential businesses and schools. As the UK population adapts to this new way of life centred around the home, new habits and perceptions may form. In this report we investigate examples of how habits have changed and how this affects the UK's Sustainability targets.

The investigation is split into two parts:

1. __Individual habits: Transportation habits and the UK's Sustainability targets.__
2. __Aggregate habits: The overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses and how their sustainability interacted with this.__

A change in transportation habits may directly impact the UK’s 25-year environmental plan, particularly the clean air target. With a shift to working from home, a reduction in traffic may also lead to a reduction in air pollution, particularly in usually congested city areas.

We define people’s habits to go beyond that of the general population, but to also include the habits of investors and businesses. Markets across the world have been severely impacted by the pandemic, which may lead to a shift in priorities and a reduction in environmental and social investment by businesses.

To meet the environmental targets, the government must work with businesses operating in the UK to ensure best sustainable practices. During these unprecedented times, businesses must be assured that good environmental, social and governance is worth pursuing, despite the economic impact of COVID-19.
