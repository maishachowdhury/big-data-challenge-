BIG DATA CHALLENGE The Big Data Challenge from R2 Data Labs, Emergent Alliance and Code First Girls is an inquiry-driven experiential learning programme that invites individuals to strengthen their problem-solving and critical thinking skills while gaining familiarity with the fundamentals of data science. Utilising challenge statements and data sets pulled together by R2 Data Labs and IBM (Emergent Alliance partner), participants will model historical data using their knowledge of data science, analytics tools and techniques while basing their observations on the data provided. Teams can also use additional open data in their projects.
